WEB APPLICATIONS
These are mostly small projects that I coded to learn the functionality of ASP.NET, .NET FRAMEWORK and the Entity Framkework.

NEWLETTERAPP: This is a basic MVC WEB APP writen with c#. it intakes contact info and organizes it into a list of contacts. It uses Razor syntax to put all input into a database.

CARINSURANCE: This is a more complicated project using C# razor and the MVC model. The app intakes you contact and driving info, runs through a list of logic and then returns a quote. The quote along with info is put into a database along with the quote. it has an admin page that shows all insurees but only first name last name email and quote.
