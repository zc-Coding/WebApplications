## WEB APPLICATIONS
Mostly small projects that I coded to learn the functionality of ASP.NET, .NET FRAMEWORK and the Entity Framkework.

#### NEWLETTERAPP: 
This is a basic MVC WEB APP writen with C#. It intakes contact info and organizes it into a list of contacts. 
Then uses Razor syntax to put all input into a database.

#### CARINSURANCE: 
This is a more complicated project using C# razor and the MVC model. The app intakes your contact and driving info, 
runs through a list of logic that modifies a base value and then returns an insurenace quote. The quote along with 
info is put into a database. The app also has an admin page that shows all insurees only displaying the first name, 
last name, email and quote.
